Data Overview
EDA
We analyze some statistic readings of data based on each feature.
It includes mean, max, min, count, std, 25% 50% 70%.

This is helpful when we preform data cleaning, feature engineering and feature selection.


K-Fold - Create subset of data to training, validation and testing before any data processing.
Data Leakage - Think about how model will see the real data. Some preprocessing can be done on testing data if those preprocessing can be done in reality.

Check Data:
Imbalance
Missing Data
Outliers
Correlations - because correlation has impact on weighting of different features, we prefer to handle correlations by removal or PCA.
